SVN::Dump
---------

This module lets you manage SVN dumps with Perl.

The reference document for Subversion dumpfiles is at:
http://svn.collab.net/viewvc/svn/trunk/notes/fs_dumprestore.txt?revision=HEAD

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS CODE IS OF IN ALPHA QUALITY. I DO NOT MASTER YET
THE CONCEPTS BEHIND THE SUBVERSION FILESYSTEM, BUT WILL EVENTUALLY LEARN.
