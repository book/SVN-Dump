About This Fork
---------------

This is a temporary fork of gitpan's SVN-Dump.  It exists to track and
distribute my patches against the module until the author publishes a
repository somewhere.  At that point, I'll replace this with a proper
fork of his work.

SVN::Dump
---------

This module lets you manage SVN dumps with Perl.

The reference document for Subversion dumpfiles is at:
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/notes/dump-load-format.txt

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS CODE IS OF IN ALPHA QUALITY. I DO NOT MASTER YET
ALL THE CONCEPTS BEHIND THE SUBVERSION FILESYSTEM, BUT WILL EVENTUALLY LEARN.
THE INTERFACE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.
